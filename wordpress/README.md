# bibliotekazukowo.pl on WordPress

The library's site runs on WordPress. This folder holds everything that is ours:
the theme, a setup script and the local development environment. Content
(posts, pages, media) lives in WordPress, not in git.

Everything runs in Docker. Nothing needs to be installed on your machine.

```

└── import/                     WordPress export files (gitignored, contains site content)
```

## Local environment

Requires Docker. The site runs at http://localhost:8088 (login `admin` / `admin`, local only).

```bash
cd wordpress
docker compose up -d                       # start WordPress + database
docker compose run --rm cli wp <command>   # run any WP-CLI command
docker compose down                        # stop (data is kept)
docker compose down -v                     # stop and delete all local data
```

The theme folder is mounted into the container, so edits show up on reload.

### Fresh copy of the live site

1. In the live site's admin: Narzędzia → Eksport → Cała zawartość → Pobierz plik eksportu.
2. Put the file in `wordpress/import/export.xml`.
3. Import it and run the setup (the import downloads all media from the live site and takes about an hour):

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose run --rm cli wp core install --url=http://localhost:8088 \
  --title=Biblioteka --admin_user=admin --admin_password=admin \
  --admin_email=admin@example.test --skip-email
docker compose run --rm cli wp post delete 1 2 3 --force   # sample content of a fresh install
docker compose run --rm cli wp language core install pl_PL --activate
docker compose run --rm cli wp plugin install wordpress-importer --activate
docker compose run --rm cli wp import /import/export.xml --authors=skip
docker compose run --rm cli wp theme activate biblioteka-zukowo
docker compose run --rm cli wp eval-file /setup/setup.php
docker compose run --rm cli wp eval-file /setup/clean-content.php
```

`clean-content.php` replaces emoji images hotlinked from Facebook (copied along
with Facebook posts) with real emoji characters and strips stray forms from posts.

## How the theme works

- **Design tokens** (colours, Montserrat, font sizes, spacing, 1280px width) are in
  `theme.json`. Staff can only pick from this palette and these sizes.
- **Templates** (`templates/`) define the home page, news list, article, page,
  search and 404. Header, footer and the "Dziś jesteśmy otwarci" bar are in `parts/`.
- **Content staff change** lives in synced patterns, which Editors can edit under
  **Stałe treści** in the admin menu:
  - *Godziny otwarcia*: one table, shown in every branch and in the "today" bar
    (a branch can have its own table instead, see below)
  - *Filie (adresy i mapa)*: branch addresses, contacts and one map of all branches
  - *Partnerzy*: partner logos
  - *Stopka: dane kontaktowe* and *Stopka: dokumenty i linki*

  Templates include them with `[bz_wzorzec slug="…"]`, so theme files never depend
  on database IDs. `setup/setup.php` creates them once and never overwrites them.
- **Today's opening hours** are worked out in `functions.php` when the page is
  rendered (no JavaScript): the "Dziś jesteśmy otwarci" bar on the home page
  (`[bz_dzisiaj]`) shows each branch's hours for today, every branch shows a
  "Dziś: …" line above its *Godziny otwarcia* toggle, and today's row in the
  table is highlighted. They are read from each branch's table in *Filie*, whose
  first column must be the Polish day name; a missing day or hours without a digit
  mean closed. To give one branch different hours (holiday, stocktaking), open
  *Filie*, select that branch's *Godziny otwarcia* block, choose "Odłącz" (detach)
  and edit its copy; the other branches keep the shared table.
  Pages are rendered fresh on every request. If a page cache is ever added, it
  must not keep pages across midnight, or the bar shows yesterday's hours.
- **Fonts** are self-hosted (no requests to Google) and preloaded, so text doesn't
  reflow when they arrive.
- **Branches map** (home page and /kontakt/): the *Filie* pattern holds a list of
  branches with their coordinates, which `assets/js/branches-map.js` turns into one
  map with a pin per branch. Each pin links to its branch section by id
  (`#banino`, …), and its popup copies that section's address and contacts, so staff
  edit them in one place. The map uses Leaflet (bundled in `assets/vendor/leaflet/`,
  loaded only on pages with the map) and OpenStreetMap tiles.
- **Catalogs**: every branch has its own catalog on szukamksiążki.pl. Each branch
  section in *Filie* has a "Katalog online" link to it, and the /katalog-online/
  page (in the main menu) lists all of them. Both are content, edited in the admin.
- **Search** in the header: a slim field on wide screens, a magnifier that opens
  the field over the bar on narrower ones (core's search block, no plugin).
- **News list view**: /aktualnosci/ and search results have a grid / list switch
  (pattern `news-view-switch`, for any query block with the `bz-news` class). The choice is kept in
  the visitor's browser (localStorage) and applied in `<head>` before the page
  paints (`functions.php`, `assets/js/news-view.js`), so cached pages work.
- **Theme version**: bump `Version` in `style.css` when adding a pattern file.
  WordPress caches the list of theme patterns per version, so a new pattern
  renders empty until the version changes. The version also busts the CSS/JS cache.
- **Page width**: pages and articles line up with the 1280px grid like the news
  list. Running text is capped at 768px for readability; columns, groups and
  galleries use the full width.
- **No plugins** are needed.

## Checks

```bash
# Blocks the editor would flag as "unexpected or invalid content"
docker compose run --rm browser validate-blocks.mjs /theme

# Automated WCAG 2.2 A/AA check (axe-core) at desktop and 320px widths
docker compose run --rm browser a11y.mjs home=http://localhost:8088/ news=http://localhost:8088/aktualnosci/

# Desktop and mobile screenshots, saved to .context/shots/<folder>/
docker compose run --rm browser screenshot.mjs /shots/<folder> home=http://localhost:8088/
```

## Production image

`Dockerfile` builds the image the cluster runs. Everything except uploads and the
database comes from it: core, the theme, Polish translations, WP-CLI, the
(inactive) importer and `bz-smtp.php`. Setup scripts are in `/opt/bz-setup`.
Every version and download is pinned; bump them in the Dockerfile together with
`compose.yml`.

GitHub Actions builds every push that touches `wordpress/` and pushes
`ghcr.io/projektbibliotekazukowo/wordpress:<git sha>`. To deploy, set `image.tag`
to that SHA in the german-lab repo (`gitops/apps/staging/biblioteka-staging.yaml`);
Argo CD rolls it out. Plugins and core can't be updated from the admin
(`DISALLOW_FILE_MODS`): updates mean rebuilding the image.

Run WP-CLI in the running pod. `wp` runs as `www-data` even from a root shell:

```bash
kubectl -n biblioteka-staging exec deploy/biblioteka-staging -- wp <command>
```

Runtime settings come from the environment: database and salts from a Secret,
`WP_HOME`, `DISABLE_WP_CRON` and the rest through `WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA`,
`BZ_NOINDEX=1` for the `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` header on staging, and
`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM` for mail.
